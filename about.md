I am a political scientist based in Seoul, South Korea, currently serving as a Research Fellow at the Sogang Institute of Political Studies.  
My research focuses on youth politics, political behavior, party membership, and public opinion.  
I have published in both international and Korean peer-reviewed journals and actively participate in academic conferences such as APSA and MPSA.  
My recent work investigates the intersection of generational conflict, democratic representation, and political participation in South Korea.

# Gi-Woo Roh, PhD  
**Research Fellow, Sogang Institute of Political Studies, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea**

Welcome to my academic homepage.
I am Gi-Woo Roh, a Research Fellow at the Sogang Institute of Political Studies in Seoul, South Korea. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Sogang University in 2025. My research interests lie in generational politics, party politics, public opinion, and political behavior.

I have published peer-reviewed articles in both English and Korean, including a co-first-authored article in *Social Science Quarterly*. My recent projects focus on party membership, political participation among older generations, and the effects of party banners.
